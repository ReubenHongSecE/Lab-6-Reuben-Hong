//Task 2: Exploring Loops
//1.
for (let i = 0; i < 11; i++) { //for loop that repeats iterates from 0 to 10
    console.log(i); //prints the value of i for the current iteration
} 

//2.
console.log("2. First five multiples of 3:") 
for (let x = 1; x < 6; x++) { //for loop that interates from 1 to 5
    let y = 3;

    console.log(x + ")", x*y) //prints the the product of the value of y and the value of x of the current iteration
}
